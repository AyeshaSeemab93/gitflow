# Git Workflow with Git Flow

This repository follows the Git Flow branching model for managing and organizing our codebase. Git Flow is a branching strategy that provides a consistent way to manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes in a collaborative environment.

## Branches in Git Flow

Git Flow defines several types of branches:

- **Main Branch:** This is our production-ready branch. Code in the main branch is considered stable and is deployed to production.

- **Develop Branch:** The development branch is where new features and changes are integrated for testing. This branch is generally less stable than `main`.

- **Feature Branches:** Feature branches are used for developing new features. .

- **Release Branches:** Release branches are created when a set of features are ready for release. They branch off develop.

- **Hotfix Branches:** Hotfix branches are used for quickly addressing critical issues in the main branch. They branch off main.
